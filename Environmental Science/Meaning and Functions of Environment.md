# Meaning and Functions of Environment

## Environment meaning

Environment can be defined as a sum total of all the living and non-living elements and their effects that influence human life. While all living or biotic elements are animals, plants, forests, fisheries, and birds, non-living or abiotic elements include water, land, sunlight, rocks, and air.

## Environment functions

**(1) Provides the supply of resources**

-       The environment offers resources for production.
-       It includes both renewable and non-renewable resources.
-       Examples: Wood for furniture, soil, land, etc.

**(2) Sustains life**

-       The environment includes the sun, soil, water, and air, which are essential for human life.
-       It sustains life by providing genetic and biodiversity.

**(3) Assimilates waste**

-       Production and consumption activities generate waste.
-       This occurs mostly in the form of garbage.
-       The environment helps in getting rid of the garbage.

**(4) Enhances the quality of life**

-       The environment enhances the quality of life.
-       Human beings enjoy the beauty of nature that includes rivers, mountains, deserts, etc.
-       These add to the quality of life.

### Renewable and Non-Renewable Resources

**(1) Renewable resources**

-       Renewable resources are the resources that can never be exhausted or depleted with continuous use.
-       There remains a continuous supply of renewable resources.
-       **Examples**: Water, trees, etc.

**(2) Non-renewable resources**

-       Non-renewable resources are the resources that get exhausted with their extraction and use.
-       **Examples**: Coal, petroleum, iron ore, etc.

# What are the 4 types of environment?

The environment is the surroundings in which an organism lives and is a crucial aspect of life on Earth. It includes all the living and non-living components that affect the survival and well-being of living organisms. The environment can be classified into four major types: terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric, and human-made environments. Each of these environments has its unique characteristics, which are determined by various factors such as climate, geography, and human activities.

### 1. Terrestrial Environment

The terrestrial environment is the land-based environment that includes forests, grasslands, deserts, and other ecosystems. This environment is characterized by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors such as soil, water, air, sunlight, and climate. The <mark>terrestrial environment can be further classified</mark> based on the type of vegetation and climate, which gives rise to various types of ecosystems such as tropical rainforests, temperate forests, savannas, tundra, and deserts. Terrestrial environments play a critical role in providing habitats for many species of plants and animals, as well as providing resources for human activities such as agriculture, forestry, and mining.#

### 2. Aquatic Environment

The aquatic environment is the water-based environment that includes oceans, lakes, rivers, wetlands, and other water bodies. This environment is characterized by a variety of abiotic factors such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, which play a crucial role in the survival of aquatic organisms. The <mark>aquatic environment can be further classified</mark> based on the salinity of the water into freshwater and marine ecosystems. Aquatic environments are home to a diverse range of organisms, including fish, amphibians, invertebrates, and algae, and provide numerous ecosystem services, such as water purification, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration.

### 3. Atmospheric Environment

The atmospheric environment refers to the gaseous layer surrounding the Earth, which includes the air we breathe, weather patterns, and climate. The atmospheric environment is characterized by the presence of various gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, which play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature and climate. The atmospheric environment is also affected by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases and climate change.

### 4. Human-Made Environment

The human-made environment is the environment created or modified by human activities, which includes cities, roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. The human-made environment is characterized by a high degree of modification of natural ecosystems, which can have significant impacts on the environment and human health. Human-made environments can also provide many benefits, such as access to resources and opportunities for social and economic development. However, they also present numerous challenges, including pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding the different types of environments and their characteristics is essential for effective conservation and management of natural resources. Each type of environment is unique and has its challenges and opportunities for sustaining life and supporting human activities. Conservation efforts should aim to balance the needs of human development with the protection of the environment to ensure a sustainable future for all.
