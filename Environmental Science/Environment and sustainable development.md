# <mark>Environment and sustainable development</mark>

## Introduction

. The economic development that we have achieved so far has come at a very heavy price-at the cost of environment quality. 

. We have to bear in mind the adverse consequences of the past development path on our environment
and consciously choose a path of sustainable development.

### Environment

• According to Environment Protection Act,
1886 “ Environment includes water, air and
land and the relationship which exists among
and between water, air, land and human being
and other creatures, plants, micro organisms
and property.

### Function of Environment

• Environment supplies resources

• Environment assimilates (absorbs) waste

• Environment sustains life(by providing genetic and bio-diversity)

• Environment provides aesthetic services.

### Environment crisis

• The environment is able to perform its
functions without any interruption as long as
the demand on these functions is within its
carrying capacity.

• Carrying capacity means

• Extraction of resources should be less than the
rate of regeneration of resources.

• Wastes generated are within the assimilating
capacity of the environment.

### Environment fails when

• The raising population of the developing
countries and the affluent consumption and
production standards of the developed world
have placed a huge stress on the environment.

• Many resources have become extinct and the
wastes generated are beyond the absorptive
capacity of the environment

### Reasons for environment crisis

• Global warming

• Ozone depletion

• Overuse and misuse of environmental
resources.

• Opportunity cost of negative environmental
impacts

• Supply demand reversal of environmental
resources.

### Environmental degradation

• Pollution

• Degradation of natural resources

• Biodiversity loss

• Management of fresh water and solid waste

### Air pollution

• Vehicular emission are of particular concern
since these are ground level sources and this,
have the maximum impact on general
population. The number of motor vehicles has
increased from about 3 lakh in 1951 to nearly
67 crore in 2003. personal transport vehicles
constitute about 80% of the total number of
registered vehicles in 2003, contributing
significantly to total air pollution load.

### Degradation of Natural Resources

• Deforestation

• Land degradation (decline in fertility of land)

### Bio diversity loss

• After independence, economic reforms caused rapid
industrialization, growing townships and urbanization.

• this has led to destruction of habitats and bio-diversity sites.

• Per capita forests land in the country is only 0.08 hectare to meet
basic needs, resulting in an excess felling of about 15million cubic
meter forests over the permissible limit resulting in loss of habitats
for animals and wild life.

• Estimate of soil erosion show that soil is being eroded at a rate of
5.3 billion tones a year for the entire country as a result of which a
country loses 0.8 million tones of nitrogen,1.8 million tones of
phosphorus ad 26.3 million tones of potassium every year.
According to government of India the quantity of nutrients lost due
to erosion each year ranges from 5.8 to 8.4 million tones.

• Some people did try to stop indiscriminate cutting of trees through
some movement like Chipko and Appiko .

### Management of fresh water and solid

waste
• In Pakistan, availability of fresh and clean water is
very low. Nearly 70% of water in Pakistan is
polluted

• There is also lack of planning and
management of solid waste, garbage is not
property collected and in some places the
garbage is dumped in open areas or into
landfills which is not only visibly ugly but also
causes diseases like dengue, malaria etc.

### Causes or factors of environmental degradation

• High growth rate of population

• Increasing urbanization

• Rapid industrialization

• Poverty

• Increase in pollution

• Increase in use of insecticides, pesticides and
fertilizers

• Massive overuse and misuse of environmental
resources.

### Measures to control environmental degradation

• Population control

• Pollution control

• Eradication of poverty

• Creating awareness among masses

• Management of solid waste

• Developing urban areas

• Suitable pattern of economic growth

• Adopting sustainable development.

# Sustainable development

The United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development defined as “ development
that meet the need of the present generation
without compromising the ability of the future
generation to meet their own needs “

### Features of SD

• Sustained rise in per capita income (real) and
economic welfare

• Ability of future generations to meet their
needs

• Rational use of environmental resources

• Control on pollution

### Steps and strategies for sustainable development

• Limiting the human population to a level within the
carrying capacity of the environment.

• Technological progress should be input efficient and
not input consuming

• Renewable resources should be extracted on a
sustainable basis, that is, rate of extraction should not
exceed rate of regeneration.

• For non-renewable resources rate of depletion should
not exceed the rate of creation of renewable
substitutes

• Inefficiencies arising from pollution should be
corrected.

### Possible strategies to achieve SD in Pakistan.

• Use of non-conventional sources of energy

• Encouraging use of cleaner fuels

• Solar power through photovoltaic cells

• Setting mini hydel plants

• Traditional knowledge and practices

• Bio composting

• Biopest control

• Organic farming

### Other measures

• Recycling the waste into compost and manure

• Creating awareness among masses about
rational use of environmental resources

• Both producers and consumers should be
conscious to be environment friendly.
